## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Feature Extraction**: Uses InceptionV3 pre-trained on ImageNet for robust image feature extraction
- 📝 **Caption Generation**: LSTM-based sequence model for generating natural language descriptions
- 🎯 **Multiple Decoding Methods**:
  - Greedy Search: Fast, deterministic caption generation
  - Beam Search: Higher quality captions with K=3 beam width
- 📊 **Performance Metrics**: BLEU-1 and BLEU-2 score evaluation
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface**: Gradio web interface for easy interaction
- 💾 **Saved Model Assets**: Pre-trained model, tokenizer, and configuration files included
- 📈 **Visualization Tools**: Built-in functions to visualize predictions with actual captions

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The image captioning model follows an encoder-decoder architecture:

### Encoder (Image Feature Extraction)
- **Model**: InceptionV3 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Input**: Images resized to 299×299×3
- **Output**: 2048-dimensional feature vector
- **Purpose**: Extracts high-level visual features from input images

### Decoder (Caption Generation)
- **Model**: LSTM-based sequence model
- **Input**: Image features + partial caption sequence
- **Output**: Next word prediction
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words to dense vectors
- **LSTM Layer**: Captures sequential dependencies in captions
- **Dense Layer**: Predicts probability distribution over vocabulary

### Caption Generation Strategies

1. **Greedy Search**:
   - Selects the most probable word at each step
   - Fast and deterministic
   - Good for real-time applications

2. **Beam Search (K=3)**:
   - Maintains top-K candidate sequences
   - Explores multiple caption possibilities
   - Produces higher quality captions
   - Better BLEU scores

### Using Pre-trained Model

```python
import pickle
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.applications.inception_v3 import InceptionV3, preprocess_input
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array

# Load model and assets
model = load_model('model/caption_model_final.keras', safe_mode=False)
with open('model_assets/tokenizer.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    tokenizer = pickle.load(f)
with open('model_assets/model_config.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    config = pickle.load(f)

# Load InceptionV3 for feature extraction
inception_model = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet')
inception_model = tf.keras.Model(
    inputs=inception_model.inputs, 
    outputs=inception_model.layers[-2].output
)

# Function to generate caption
def generate_caption(image_path):
    # Load and preprocess image
    img = load_img(image_path, target_size=(299, 299))
    img = img_to_array(img)
    img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)
    img = preprocess_input(img)
    
    # Extract features
    features = inception_model.predict(img, verbose=0)
    features = features.flatten()
    
    # Generate caption using greedy search
    in_text = 'start'
    for _ in range(config['max_caption_length']):
        sequence = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([in_text])[0]
        sequence = pad_sequences([sequence], maxlen=config['max_caption_length'])
        prediction = model.predict([features.reshape(1, -1), sequence], verbose=0)
        idx = np.argmax(prediction)
        word = tokenizer.index_word[idx]
        in_text += ' ' + word
        if word == 'end':
            break
    
    caption = in_text.replace('start ', '').replace(' end', '')
    return caption

# Generate caption for an image
caption = generate_caption('path/to/your/image.jpg')
print(f"Generated Caption: {caption}")
```

### Using Gradio Interface

The notebook includes a Gradio interface for easy testing:

```python
# The interface is defined in the notebook
# Simply run the last cells to launch the web interface
iface.launch()
```

This will start a local web server where you can:
- Upload images
- Get captions using both Greedy Search and Beam Search
- Compare the results

## 📈 Model Performance

The model is evaluated using BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores:

### Evaluation Metrics
- **BLEU-1**: Measures unigram precision (individual word matches)
- **BLEU-2**: Measures bigram precision (two consecutive word matches)

### Performance Characteristics
- **Greedy Search**: Faster inference, good for real-time applications
- **Beam Search (K=3)**: Higher BLEU scores, better caption quality

### Sample Results
The model generates captions like:
- "a dog is running through the grass"
- "a group of people are standing on a beach"
- "a child is playing with a ball"

*Note: Actual performance metrics depend on the training configuration and dataset split.*
